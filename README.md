## Installation

### via `pip`

You can install the latest release via [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

pip install ape-addressbook
```

### via `setuptools`

You can clone the repository and use [`setuptools`](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools) for the most up-to-date version:

## Quick Usage

To use the addressbook in a project, add common addresses to your `ape-config.yaml` file like this:

```yaml
addressbook:
    shared_account: "0x2192f6112a026bce4047CeD2A16553Fd31E798B6"
```

Then, to use the address, import the addressbook and access it via the alias set in the config:

```python
from ape_addressbook import addressbook

address = addressbook["shared_account"]
```
